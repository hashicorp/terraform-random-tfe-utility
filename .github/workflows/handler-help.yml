            > | ------- | ----------- |
            > | /test <all\|full-aws\|full-azure\|full-google\|test case name...> [destroy=false] | Run the Terraform test workflow on the modules in the tests/ directory in each of the terraform-aws-terraform-enterprise, terraform-azurerm-terraform-enterprise, and terraform-google-terraform-enterprise module repositories. Unnamed arguments can be "all" to run all test cases, full-[aws\|azure\|google] to run all cloud specific cases, or specific test case names to only run selected cases. The named argument "destroy=false" will disable the destruction of test infrastructure for debugging purposes. |
            > | /destroy <all\|full-aws\|full-azure\|full-google\|test case name...> | Destroy any resources that may still be in Terraform state from previous tests. Unnamed arguments can be "all" to destroy all resources from all test cases, full-[aws\|azure\|google] to destroy all resources from cloud specific cases, or specific test case names to only destroy selected test case resources. |
